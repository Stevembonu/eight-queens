# eight-queens
Program takes chess queens positions from a user and attempts to sort the chessboard by moving every attacked queen that can be moved to a minimum conflict position.
Will return 'Success' if there are no queens left attacking each other. Otherwise will return 'Failure'

To compile and run EightQueens.java :

 Make sure you have Java already installed. Ensure that the EightQueens.java and the infile.txt are in the same folder. 

 Open your Windows Command Prompt or your Ubuntu Terminal and navigate to the folder in which you have the EightQueens.java and infile.txt

 To compile the java file, enter and execute the code below :


javac EightQueens.java


After it compiles, enter and execute the code below to run it :


java EightQueens


 The EightQueens.java will read the infile.txt automatically and outfile.txt will be created in the same folder that has the EightQueens.java and the infile.txt
   The Command Prompt or the Terminal will display the same output as well.

   The code will always overwrite the old outfile.txt when another infile is used.
